This Repository is meant to hold files pertaining to the ECE 4424 - Machine Learning Final Project.

Our project involves:
- Continuously collecting data from the McComas Gym live occupancy website
- Storing the data along with date, time, and weather into csv files
- Creating a model/using an existing model to predict the occupancy of McComas Gym given weather, time, and a date/day of the week
- More to be added as requirements are encountered.
